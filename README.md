# edge-ai-optimization
Some practical Python scripts for AI model optimization

## Script

**edge_ai_optimization.py**

The script provides 5 key optimization techniques:

Quantization - reduces precision for smaller size

Pruning - removes unnecessary weights

Knowledge Distillation - trains smaller models

ONNX Export - optimizes for deployment

Benchmarking - measures performance
